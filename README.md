# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Biochemistry and Genetics at the University of Auckland.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I believe data science skills are essential for modern biological research and will be highly valuable for my planned postgraduate study in forensic science.
- I am interested in learning about data visualisation, reproducible reserach, and further developing my R programming skills after taking BIOSCI 220, and applying data science techniques to biological datasets.
